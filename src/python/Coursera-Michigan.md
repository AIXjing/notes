# Python Course (University of Michigan)
https://www.coursera.org/learn/python/home/welcome

>I took the course in Feb. 2018 without any coding experience before. However, I do not feel I really get Python because of lack of practice/exercise.<br>
>My interests start moving to data analysis recently, and I realized Python is a powerful tool in the world of data analytics. Therefore, I tried to pick up the course again and hopefully I could know it better this time (after I finished CS50 last year)

print('US floor', usf)

def abc():

\\( \int x dx = \frac{x^2}{2} + C \\)


\\[ 
    \mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=0} x_i \\\\
    \int_0^\infty \mathrm{e}^{-x}\,\mathrm{d}x
