# Improve your statistical inferences


## Week 1

### 1.1 Frequentism, Likelihoods, Bayesian statistics

### 1.2 What is p-value? 

### 1.2.1 p-value

**A p-value is the probability of getting the observed or more extreme data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.**

A p-value is the probability of the data, NOT the probability of a theory.

\\(P(D*|H) \neq P(H|D)\\)   

*Bayesian statistics is the only approach that will allow you to make statements about the probability that a theory is true.*

If a p > 0.05, the data we have observed is not surprising. It does not mean there is NO true effect. You need large samples to detect small effects.

### 1.2.2 Using p-value orrectly

Use p-value as a rule to guide behavior in the long run.
